Donâ€™t attempt to feed, catch,or pet a wild animal. Never approach wildlife babies or animal mothers with their babies; the motherâ€™s protective response can be very fierce. Report injured or aggressive animals to authorities; donâ€™t attempt to give aid to injured wildlife. If an injured animal approaches you, move slowly away.Mountain lion sightings are rare, but they have been known to attack humans. If you do encounter a mountain lion, donâ€™t run. Stay calm and hold your position or back away slowly. Convince the animal that youâ€™re not prey and that you might be dangerous. Face the lion and try to appear as large as possible by standing upright and raising your arms. If the lion acts aggressively, wave your arms and shout. Grab a stick or throw objects",
